          <p>We are a family of four plus our Solar dog Kalleigh who live in beautiful Kamloops, BC.</p>
          <p> Nikki grew up in Prince George, BC and moved to Kamloops after graduating from high school in 2002. She obtained a degree in Geography and Environmental Studies form Thompson Rivers University in 2013. This is where her passion for the environment and sustainability started. </p>
          <p>  Greg also grew up in Prince George, BC and moved to Kamloops with Nikki in 2002. He has been in the construction industry for over 20 years, Greg holds an inter-provincial electrical TQ, a Class B electrical contracting license, and FSR designation in the province of BC. Seven years ago, Greg joined <a href="https://www.riversideenergy.ca/"   target="_blank"> Riverside Energy Systems,</a> an environmentally conscious business dedicated to the supply, installation and maintenance of solar systems.</a> In 2015, he became a principal in the company. He is passionate about the solar industry and loves “lighting” up homes and businesses.</p>
          <p>They have two children; Noel who is three and Callum who is one. They also have a ten-year-old Staffordshire X Blue Heeler named Kalleigh. </p>
          <p><center>Together we are the Solar Family</center></p>
          <p>For the last few years we had always talked about having a solar set up. However, our home at the time was not a suitable site. Last spring, we purchased a new to us home and it was a perfect location for a solar setup! With me being on maternity leave and my husband working a busy schedule we were not able to get our system up until this spring. I am so happy to say that it is now up and running and we are making power! We have an app that monitors our production which we excitedly look at multiple times a day! And we are looking forward to getting our first power bill to see how much we are saving!</p>
