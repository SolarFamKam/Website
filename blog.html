        <p>The system is composed of 4 -335 watt, 72 celled solar modules. Using micro â€“inverters, power is converted from DC to AC on the roof. There are no batteries or backup, it is strictly a grid tied system that uses the power immediately and any extra is sold back into the grid. We have designed or system so that it can easily be expanded. Our hope is that by next year we will have 28 panels on our roof!</p>
        <p>I will be posting weekly blogs with updates about our system and general information about a solar set up. Posts will be in understandable language so that followers can learn about a solar set up without the solar jargon! My blog will also include tips on how to live sustainably. For example, gardening, recycling, buying local, etc.</P>
        <p>I hope you all enjoyed my first ever blog! Please contact me if you have any questions. I have included the links to Riverside Energy if you want to check out their web page, Instagram or Facebook.</p>
        <p>Love, light and laughter to you and yours,</P>
        <p>The Solar Family</p>
