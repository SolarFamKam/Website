          <p>The system is composed of 4 -335 watt, 72 celled solar modules. Using micro –inverters, power is converted from DC to AC on the roof. There are no batteries or backup, it is strictly a grid tied system that uses the power immediately and any extra is sold back into the grid. We have designed or system so that it can easily be expanded. Our hope is that by next year we will have 28 panels on our roof!</p>
          <p>I will be posting weekly blogs with updates about our system and general information about a solar set up. Posts will be in understandable language so that followers can learn about a solar set up without the solar jargon! My blog will also include tips on how to live sustainably. For example, gardening, recycling, buying local, etc.</P>
          <p>I hope you all enjoyed my first ever blog! Please contact me if you have any questions. I have included the links to Riverside Energy if you want to check out their web page, Instagram or Facebook.</p>
          <p>Love, light and laughter to you and yours,</P>

          <p>Our journey as a Solar Family started seven years ago; however, our Solar Home only just started this April (2020). We are so excited to see how much our system produces! For people who are not familiar with solar systems, I have provided some information and relevant links to their sources.</p>
      <h4>Solar Energy</h4>
        <p>Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available.<a href="https://www.seia.org/initiatives/about-solar-energy" target="_blank"> (Solar  Energy Industries Association)</a></p>
      <h4>Advantages of Solar Energy</h4>
        <p>The key advantage of solar power systems is that they help reduce pollution from power generation. By contrast, burning fuels for energy produces pollutants such as particulate matter, Sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2) and hazardous waste.</p>
      <h4>Disadvantages of Solar Energy</h4>
        <p>The chief disadvantages are low energy density and intermittency.</p>
        <p>Energy density refers to the amount of potential energy a given amount of fuel contains. No technology can convert all the primary energy in a fuel into usable energy. Fossil fuels have very high energy density. They produce a lot of usable energy, even if the conversion is inefficient. Solar energy has relatively low energy density, which conversion reduces further. The least efficient solar conversion technologies are those that produce electricity. Those that convert it into thermal energy are more efficient.</p>
        <p>Since sunlight is intermittent, solar power cannot be generated as consistently and predictably as power from other fuel sources. <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/solar-energy" target="_blank"> (Canadian Encyclopedia)</a></p>
      <h4>Environmental Considerations</h4>
        <p>The primary benefit of solar generation is that it emits no pollutants or GHGs; However, some GHGs are released during the production, transportation, and assembly of PV cells. Using land for solar farms also raises concerns about land degradation and habitat impacts. Finally, solar panels can create waste when they become defunct, as few places recycle old solar panels. <a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/lctrct/rprt/2017cnddptnrnwblpwr/slr-eng.html" target="_blank"> (Canadian Energy Regulator)</a>
      <h4>Our System</h4>
        <p>As mentioned in my first blog, our system is composed of 4 -335 watt, 72 celled solar modules. It also comes with amazing app for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apsemaappforandroid&hl=en_CA" target="_blank">Android</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/ema-app/id984843541" target="_blank">Apple.</a> Here are some of the screenshots from today’s solar energy capture.</p>
        <p>I hope that my second blog has captivated your interest and keeps you wanting to learn more about solar energy! My next blog will be up soon! Possibly about how I reduce my environmental impact!</p>
        <p>Love, light and laughter to you and yours,</p>

        <p>I hope you liked our last blog! (The Solar Family) Today’s blog will have slightly different content. I would like to talk about how I am reducing my carbon footprint and how to live more green and sustainably!</p>
      <h4>Sustainability is defined as:</h4>
        <p>[ suh-stey-nuh-bil-i-tee ]</p>
        ________________________________________
        <p>noun</p>
        <p>The ability to be sustained, supported, upheld, or confirmed.</p>
        <p>Environmental Science. the quality of not being harmful to the environment or depleting natural resources, and thereby supporting long-term ecological balance <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sustainability" target="_blank"> (Dictionary).</a></p>
        <p>We as a western nation have become a one-time use society. We use something once, then we throw it away. Society is now realizing that this is not ecologically viable. There are so many resources out there to teach us how we can live more sustainably, so we can leave this beautiful earth for many more generations to come.</p>
      <h4>Here are some of the things I do to reduce my carbon footprint and live sustainably.</h4>
      <h4>Recycle:</h4> Kamloops has a city run recycling program. But there is so much more I can recycle  that is not picked up by the city. I hope by the beginning of summer to have a complete recycling station in my garage.
      <h4>Buy local:</h4> I try to buy local products when shopping at big box stores (Costco and superstore), I only buy meat from local, ethically treated farms.
      <h4>Buy used clothing:</h4> 99% of the clothing for my children is used. There are many Facebook groups that sell used kids closed in excellent used condition for a fraction of the price.
      <h4>Beeswax wraps:</h4> I had taken a class through the Kamloops Museum on how to make beeswax wraps, it was so fun.
      <h4>Bento boxes:</h4> I have multiple different types of bento boxes. I also use the plastic reusable ones for meal prep, they are freezer safe.
      <h4>Wool Dryer Balls:</h4>These are a great addition to your laundry line up. They are great for natural fibers, not so great for synthetic as they still have static.
      <h4>Green Laundry Detergent:</h4> I use Nellie’s washing soda and recently just bought the Thieves line from Young Living.
      <h4>Green Dish soap and Dish Washing Detergent:</h4> I mix regular washing detergent with the ECOS dish washing detergent. I find that the ECOS isn’t the greatest, that is why I mix it. However, the Seventh Generation and Method brands are great.
      <h4>Green Cleaning Products:</h4>I use Thieves oil (from Young Living) and vinegar to clean my floors. And I use a couple different other "green" brands for cleaning supplies.
      <h4>Eating mostly vegetarian</h4> Unless we get local ethically raised meats. We used to eat meat for almost every meal. Then we started doing Meatless Mondays, which turned into more vegetarian/vegan meals. We now eat meat about once a week, my husband has been a vegan since December 2019. We have friends that have chickens, pigs and cows for our eggs, pork and beef. So any meat we purchase is from a local, ethically raised farm.</p>
      <h4>Silicone bowl covers:</h4>These are amazing, they cover bowls without compromising the seal and are reusable.
      <h4>Silicone Straws:</h4>No one time use straws here. They are dishwasher safe, which is great.
      <h4>Turn off lights that I am not using.</h4>
      <h4>Have a programmable thermostat</h4>
      <h4>Only do full loads of laundry</h4>
      <h4>Have a solar set up</h4>
      <h4>Grow an edible garden</h4>
      <h4>Products I Use to Live More Sustainably</h4>

      <h4>What other people can do:</h4>
      <h4>Take public transportation, carpool, take your bike</h4>
      <h4>Think about if it’s a need or a want</h4>
      <h4>Reduce your plastic use</h4>
        <p>I have included a link to a great website for you to look at if you are interested in reducing your carbon footprint Global Stewards.</p>
        <p>I am not going to lie and say that I live green all the time. I drive an SUV, I do buy plastic packaged items, I have two children and we live in a fair sized home. However, it’s not one person doing everything that makes a difference its many people doing small things that do!</p>
        <p>Love, light and laughter to you and yours,</p>
